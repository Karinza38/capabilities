	     <h2>Introduction</h2>
									   
<p>This document describes some capabilities that can be provided by overlays "at the edge", and attempts to answer several questions about them. The questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source: What is the role of the author (or content source code developer) in providing this capability and ensuring that it is accessible.</li>

<li>Trade-offs When this capability is enabled on the edge, does it potentially duplicate functionality elsewhere in the stack? In particular, we consider all the possibilities near the edge namely the CDN, operating system, user-agent, browser extension, assistive technology, and/or javascript overlay. If so, can (and should) this redundancy be avoided?</li>

<li>Benefit: What is the potential benefit of performing this capability at the edge?</li>

<li>Related topics</li>
</ul>

	<h2>Creating Accessible UX</h2>

<section id="usertrig">
<h3>User-triggered Transformations</h3>

<p>User can be afforded  the opportunity to opt-in to various transformations via interactive personalization menus: The end-user can access a list of available enhancements and enable those they require. </p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>Users tend to require the same types of accomodations across all sites and all content sources. Therefore, facilitating this capability in the source is likely the least useful place to locate it, because that would require the user to select the same enhancements time and again across the succession of sites visited and likely with different menu organization site to site. </dd>

<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>Many of the capabilities made available by user-triggered opt-ins are often also found in multiple places at the edge. For example, contrast adjustment is generally found  in operating system display settings, in browser and app user-agents (e.g. dark mode/light mode), and in browser extensions, and in javascripted (CDN hosted) overlays. Such redundancy can easily lead to confusion. This confusion may be further exacerbated because certain settings the user finds helpful may be available only in one of these locations, and not in all of them. Furthermore, users are frequently not particularly knowledgeable about their operating system settings menus, especially as these tend to move with each OS revision (to take one example). This can make it difficult to locate these features, especially when we recognize that once satisfactorily configured they are generally not reset (meaning that the user doesn't need to revisit that menu location and soon forgets where it is). On the other hand, locating the accommodation consistently proximate to the user offers the highest likelihood of maximal benefit provided  the accommodation  is easily identified and invoked without conflicts. This also provides the best opportunity for easing the burden of invoking the same accommodation across a user&apos;s multiple devices.</dd>

<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>Users can select and optimally tune the types of accomodations that they require. Any device on the edge may also have knowledge of other devices on the edge, that may need the same adjustments, and edge technology could propagate these settings to those other devices. MacOS Ventura (MacOS 13.2) is already doing this for wifi passwords when an IOS device configured for the same network is proximate.</dd>

<section id="autobgproc">
<h3>Fully Automated Transformations</h3>

	<p>Sometimes automated transformations are applied based on conditions edge technology discovers in the user&apos;s technology.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>Content providers have long sought to tailor UX behavior based on what capabilities could be discovered about the user&apos;s operating environment. What browser is in use? Is a screen reader in use? Indeed, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#recap3">Google&apos;s automated Recaptcha 3 is deeply dependent on just such data gathering</a>.
</dd>

<dt>Trade-offs</dt> 
<dd>While a well-crafted remediation
	technology may disappear from users&apos; consciousness, it is both
risky and presumptuous to presume there will be no users who will not
experience some kind of accessibility challenge even among the best crafted remediation technologies.
Furthermore, persons with disabilities tend to be  concerned about content
providers discovering and monetizing  user data. Their lived reality has made
them highly desirous to preserve their privacy because of perceived and actual
experience of discrimination over many years.
	However, the automated UX transformation approach can provide clear benefits. One example is  real-time applications such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/raur/">Real Time Communications (RTC)</a>. 
	Immediacy matters. ASR captions may not provide the desired quality, but the alternative may too often be no captions whatsoever. 
	Similarly missing image descriptions generated by A-I may prove more helpful to the user coping with a substandard page than no alternative text at all. 
	Pages whose content remains unremediated can also tend to encourage users to seek alternative providers. 
	</dd>

<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>Users do indeed expect their technologies will operate automatically and seamlessly to provide an accessible and functional experience. This is an accepted technological expectation. Content providers do not err in attempting to meet this expectation. The error arises from leaving the user out of the decision loop.</dd>

<dt>Related Topics</dt>
<dd>
	This capability is in direct conflict with <a href="usrctrl">Preserving User Agency</a> below.

<section id="usrctrl">
<h3>Preserving User Agency</h3>

<p>Users will not care how a functional and accessible experience is assembled as long as their needs are met. However, they are, and must always be understood as the ultimate arbiters of whether their needs are actually being met.
Consequently,
UX processing should be easily discoverable and defeatable. Users need to be empowered to act should they believe an unmediated experience would be superior. Preserving user agency is simply smart business strategy no matter how excellent the the technology may actually be.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>Content providers can, and often do provide various levels of content transformation opportunities to users.
</dd>

<dt>Trade-offs</dt> 
<dd><q>Nothing about us without us</q> is a deeply held
	principle expressing a core criterion of disability equity. For this reason alone it is
important to preserve user agency by offering a defeat option. Nothing is
gained when users are forced to contend with a remediation technology they
suspect may be contributing to their accessibility challenges, even if the
ultimate reality demonstrates that their suspicion is actually incorrect.
	</dd>

<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>A core user perogative is honored.</dd>

<dt>Related Topics</dt>
<dd>
	This capability is in direct conflict with <a href="autobgproc">Fully Automated Background UX Transformations</a> above. Preserving user agency is so critical that we call it out separately as a critical capability for edge technologies. Too often it is the only feature missing from a <a href="autobgproc">Fully Automated Background UX Transformations</a> capability.

<section id="notify">
<h3>Notifications</h3>

<p>Messages shown to the end-user to
alert them to an event, some specific datapoint, or to some state. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>It seems unlikely source could fully take on this responsibility. 
On the other hand it seems equally unlikely that edge technology alone can fully meet this need effectively without API-based data interchange with source content.
	There is particularly cogent needs in <q>augmented reality</q> which are potentially very exciting.
</dd>
<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>What a user may want or need to know in any given situation or moment is a complex calculation at best. 
	It's far too easy to overdo notifications, though failing to notify judiciously and appropriately would constitute a major technological opportunity missed. 
	We need better models and privacy-preserving context awareness to realize all the benefits conceivable in this application of automated opportunities.</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>Controlling the firehose of notifications is best filtered and managed at the edge because that&apos;s the most data rich locus for technology mediated adaptation and minimal data round-trips to servers.
	The right information at just the right time can serve as a tremendous quality of life enhancement and it&apos;s best performed locally, not centrally.
</dd>
</dl>

</section>
<section id="portable">
<h3>cross-Device Preference Profiles</h3>

<p>Users now frequently use several devices. Furthermore, users tend to have the same or very similar accessibility requirements regardless of the device they may be using in the moment. 
	It is therefore an emerging goal in web accomodations to support the user in configuring once and having their configured preference propagate across all their devices. 
	This propagation should function across all vendors and operating environments.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>While technically feasible in source, this is not being done by content source today, and we are not aware of any proposals to add such functionality in content source&mdash;likely for a multiplicity of reasons.
	People, regardless of ability or disability, may often want to withhold this information from a source provider, and would certainly not want it to propagate to 
	source providers outside of their knowledge or control.</dd>

<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>
	A privacy-preserving, cross-platform U-I configuring capability is now a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/Meetings/Minutes/2022-09-15-vcwg#section8">long-term goal in the W3C Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group.</a> 
	Such a capability has long been desired and is arguably now more achievable than ever before. 
	It would  clearly be valuable to users. 
	For example, blind users and people on slow internet connections will benefit from setting their browsers to not download images. 
	It will nevertheless require nuanced implementation, e.g.  screen size and consequent decisions over preferred fonts, spacing, and contrasts  will likely vary by screen size and environmental conditions. 
	Another example of a nuanced consideration is the likely desire of a screen reader user to operate sometimes with TTS, but other times with braille (or both braille and TTS).
</dd>

<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>Configure once and deploy everywhere, with the setting propagating to other contexts.</dd>
<dt>Related Topics</dt>

While this capability remains aspirational in the main as of this writing, it is nevertheless an achievable goal for which edge technology is optimally suited. Many other capabilities enumerated in this document will point to this capability as an optimal implementation objective.

<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>This capability is commonly configurable in
the operating system itself. Thus edge support needs a compelling reason to diverge from OS defaults.

<h3>Automated Detection of WCAG Violations</h3>

<p>Algorithmic detection of violations of WCAG 2.x success criteria is considered here as a vector for providing the user a more conformant experience. 
	Large, complex and highly dynamic source sites are literally unable to reproduce every user experience permutation in their test beds. Automated detection and
