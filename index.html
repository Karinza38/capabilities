	     <h2>Introduction</h2>

	<section id="edgedef">
		<h3>What is meant by <q>Edge?</q></h3>

		<p>The term <q>edge technology</q> refers to that portion of the assembled presentation of web content most proximate to the content user. Typically it is:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>The user agent (with its user chosen plugins and extensions) together with the physical device the user uses to read and interact with web content;</li>
			<li>But more powerfully (as we shall soon see), it is the last compositor of content delivered to the user. It is of course cloud-based. And, while it might not be geographically proximate to the user, it functions most powerfully when it functions as the user's proxy agent for organizing web content in the manner the user is best able to use.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Both of these are privileged positions providing access to much information about the user and how the user functions. Much of what we discuss in this document assumes a trusted (and trustable) relationship with and on behalf of the user. Though we recognize the trust relationship inherent in edge positioned technology is today more honoured in the breach, we choose to explore the tremendous accessibility opportunities available when this trust relationship is rather honoured in the obserfvance/p>

	        <h3>Web Content Today</h3>

		  <p>In the main the classic paradigm of a web domain owner serving content directly to end users across the Internet has long ago become a historical artifact.
		    Today&apos;s typical web page is often a dizzying composite of multiple content streams injected from various sources, including content unique to the user&apos;s locale and even to the specific user herself. Content
		    delivered to a user today may be a unique <q>one-off</q> composite that will change if the page is refresheda According to the <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2021/third-parties">2021 Web Almanac</a> notes more
		    than 20 third party injection streams for today&apos;s typical web site, with 10% containing over 90 separate content injections.</p>

		    <div class="ednote"><strong>EDITOR&apos;S NOTE</strong><br><p>
			        We need a good graphic here.</p></div>

		    <p>The source of the typical website
		    today is actually many sources.

		    <p>Even third-party plugins aren&apos;t always created by a single
		    source. Few developers exclusively use their own code. They rely on
		    libraries, components and frameworks to build their plugins.
		    Edge technologies may actually be best placed to help overcome the problem
		    of substandard accessibility in composite content delivered to end users by identifying precisely the accessibility challenges that end users may experience and helping remediate them where it matters most&mdash;at the user
		    level, for the simple reason that technology based tracking and reporting can examine far more end user payload deliveries than human testing will ever cover. Whether the resulting remediation is an inprocess transformation,
		    or an upstream recoding, gathering and reporting many samples to upstream end points is arguably the most efficient way to spot anomalous patterns (and a great application for <a>A-I</a> analysis).</p>

			<h3>About This Document</h3>

	     <p>This document describes some capabilities important to web content accessibility that can be provided by overlays <q>at the edge</q>, and attempts to answer several questions about them. The questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source: What is the role of the author (or content source code developer) in providing this capability and ensuring that it is accessible.</li>

<li>Trade-offs When this capability is enabled on the edge, does it potentially duplicate functionality elsewhere in the stack? In particular, we consider all the possibilities near the edge namely the CDN, operating system, user-agent, browser extension, assistive technology, and/or javascript overlay. If so, can (and should) this redundancy be avoided?</li>

<li>Benefit: What is the potential benefit of performing this capability at the edge?</li>

<li>Related topics</li>

<h1>Meeting Users&apos; Needs</h1>

<p>

The capabilities discussed in this section are (or should be) controlled by the user. These are accomodations that allow users to interact with content in the way that works best for them. Whatever a content provider may have published, a user's adaptations must take precedence for accessibility to be preserved. It is critical to recognize that the user of web content is the ultimate arbiter of how it should be presented. Or, to put it in other words: <q>The author proposes; but the user disposes.</q></p>

	<h2>Creating Accessible UX</h2>

<section id="usrctrl">
<h3>Preserving User Agency</h3>

<p>Users will not care how a functional and accessible experience is assembled as long as their needs are met. However, they are, and must always be understood as the ultimate arbiters of whether their needs are actually being met.
Consequently,
UX processing should be easily discoverable and defeatable. Users need to be empowered to act should they believe an unmediated experience would be superior. Preserving user agency is simply smart business strategy no matter how excellent the the technology may actually be.
</p>

<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>Content providers can, and often do provide various levels of content transformation opportunities to users.
</dd>

<dt>Trade-offs</dt> 
<dd><q>Nothing about us without us</q> is a deeply held
	principle expressing a core criterion of disability equity. For this reason alone it is
important to preserve user agency by offering a defeat option. Nothing is



gained when users are forced to contend with a remediation technology they
suspect may be contributing to their accessibility challenges, even if the
ultimate reality demonstrates that their suspicion is actually incorrect.

<h3>User-triggered Transformations</h3>

<p>User can be afforded  the opportunity to opt-in to various transformations via interactive personalization menus: The end-user can access a list of available enhancements and enable those they require. </p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>Users tend to require the same types of accomodations across all sites and all content sources. Therefore, facilitating this capability in the source is likely the least useful place to locate it, because that would require the user to select the same enhancements time and again across the succession of sites visited and likely with different menu organization site to site. </dd>

<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>Many of the capabilities made available by user-triggered opt-ins are often also found in multiple places at the edge. For example, contrast adjustment is generally found  in operating system display settings, in browser and app user-agents (e.g. dark mode/light mode), and in browser extensions, and in javascripted (CDN hosted) overlays. Such redundancy can easily lead to confusion. This confusion may be further exacerbated because certain settings the user finds helpful may be available only in one of these locations, and not in all of them. Furthermore, users are frequently not particularly knowledgeable about their operating system settings menus, especially as these tend to move with each OS revision (to take one example). This can make it difficult to locate these features, especially when we recognize that once satisfactorily configured they are generally not reset (meaning that the user doesn't need to revisit that menu location and soon forgets where it is). On the other hand, locating the accommodation consistently proximate to the user offers the highest likelihood of maximal benefit provided  the accommodation  can be easily identified and invoked. This also provides the best opportunity for easing the burden of invoking the same accommodation across a user&apos;s multiple devices.</dd>

<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>Users can select and optimally tune the types of accomodations that they require. Any device on the edge may also have knowledge of other devices on the edge, that may need the same adjustments, and edge technology could propagate these settings to those other devices. MacOS Ventura (MacOS 13.2) is already doing this for wifi passwords when an IOS device configured for the same network is proximate.</dd>

<section id="notify">
<h3>Notifications</h3>

<p>Messages shown to the end-user to
alert them to an event, some specific datapoint, or to some state. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>It seems unlikely source could fully take on this responsibility. 
On the other hand it seems equally unlikely that edge technology alone can fully meet this need effectively without API-based data interchange with source content.
	There is particularly cogent needs in <q>augmented reality</q> which are potentially very exciting.
</dd>
<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>What a user may want or need to know in any given situation or moment is a complex calculation at best. 
	It's far too easy to overdo notifications, though failing to notify judiciously and appropriately would constitute a major technological opportunity missed. 
	We need better models and privacy-preserving context awareness to realize all the benefits conceivable in this application of automated opportunities.</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>Controlling the firehose of notifications is best filtered and managed at the edge because that&apos;s the most data rich locus for technology mediated adaptation and minimal data round-trips to servers.
	The right information at just the right time can serve as a tremendous quality of life enhancement and it&apos;s best performed locally, not centrally.

<section id="portable">
<h3>cross-Device Preference Profiles</h3>

<p>Users now frequently use several devices. Furthermore, users tend to have the same or very similar accessibility requirements regardless of the device they may be using in the moment. 
	It is therefore an emerging goal in web accomodations to support the user in configuring once and having their configured preference propagate across all their devices. 
	This propagation should function across all vendors and operating environments.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>While technically feasible in source, this is not being done by content source today, and we are not aware of any proposals to add such functionality in content source&mdash;likely for a multiplicity of reasons.
	People, regardless of ability or disability, may often want to withhold this information from a source provider, and would certainly not want it to propagate to 
	source providers outside of their knowledge or control.</dd>

<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
<dd>
	A privacy-preserving, cross-platform U-I configuring capability is now a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/Meetings/Minutes/2022-09-15-vcwg#section8">long-term goal in the W3C Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group.</a> 
	Such a capability has long been desired and is arguably now more achievable than ever before. 
	It would  clearly be valuable to users. 
	For example, blind users and people on slow internet connections will benefit from setting their browsers to not download images. 
	It will nevertheless require nuanced implementation, e.g.  screen size and consequent decisions over preferred fonts, spacing, and contrasts  will likely vary by screen size and environmental conditions. 
	Another example of a nuanced consideration is the likely desire of a screen reader user to operate sometimes with TTS, but other times with braille (or both braille and TTS).

	<h2>Structural Semantics Remediation</h2>

	<p>WCAG explains in painstaking detail the critical importance to accessibility of structural markup. It is a fundamental requirement and any means to remediate or improve missing structural markup provides an immediate functional enhancement to users whose accessibility accomodations rely on explicit structural semantics.</p>

<section id="structure">
	<h3>Expose Structural Semantics</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
It has long been agreed that published content should contain structural markup as provided by HTML and explained by wCAG. Not only is this critical for accessibility, additional processing to further tailor content presentation to particular user needs will rely on proper structural markup, preferably provided by source content.
</dd>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd>
	There is no inherent value to creating structural markup in edge technology. Doing so is clearly a remedial action to close a critical gap. On the other hand and as previously noted content delivered to end users today is most frequently a composite mashup of multiple input streams and not the simple delivery of content from a single source repository. The very act of mashing together multiple streams introduces a liklihood of semantic incoherency. The very word itself, <q>mashup,</q> strongly suggests a lack of concern for the coherency of the ultimate composite as delivered to the end user. Thus, anything that can be done to introduce greater semantic coherency is of benefit to all users, and especially those users relying on accessibility supporting features such as coherent and explicit structure. Lastly, as also previously noted, emerging strategies to further tailor content interaction to particular user&apos;s interaction preferences will rely on good structural markup, and these adaptations will, necessarily, be produced in edge technologies.
</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>
	Whether as a temporary remedial expedient or the advanced personalization adaptation now emerging from W3C accessibility standards, or somewhere inbetween, users simply deserve the best structural semantics that can be provided them in the moment when they seek to interact with web content. Any and all philosophical <q>should</q> arguments must give way to this simple rubric.
</dd>
</dl>

</section>

<section id="structnorm">
	<h3>Normalize the Structural Composite</h3>

	<p>
	Many users with accessibility needs rely heavily on consistency in the user interface. Yet no standard exists, nor is likely ever to require certain common controls be located consistently across sites. This is very much in the design perogative of the individual content publisher. And, while individual sites may be fully consistent in where they locate controls on the pages they publish, the user who comparison shops will encounter a different site consistently locating the same controls differently. The publisher has done nothing wrong, but the user is forced to rely on a perfect memory or put up with time-consuming strategies for locating these controls. Consider this example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The user needs to make a reservation on a travel site and will shop several sites to compare offers.</li>
		<li>Necessarily this involves picking (or specifying) dates.</li>
		<li>Typically a starting date is specified first.</li>
		<li>At this point the user needs to locate the control for switching to the specification of the end date.</li>
		<li>Where is it on this site? Is it at the upper right? The lower left? Some other location on screen on this particular site which is different from other sites the user has searched?</li>
		<li>Note that no amount of swiping on a touch-screen will ever encounter these controls. Swiping focus will remain in the date-picker widget</li>
		<li>Searching for these controls risks activating a control irrelevant to the current task such as a notification screen. This further complicates the user&apos;s predicament and wastes yet more of the user&apos;s time.</li>
	</ul>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
	By definition this conundrum cannot be resolved by a source content publisher.
</dd>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd>
	None. Only an edge technology can hope to ameliorate the situation.
</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>
	An edge technology can bring consistency and predictability to the user experience across whatever sites the user may access by locating similar controls similarly.
</dd>
</dl>

</section>

<section id="FormLabel">
<h3>Form Labels</h3>

		<p>Forms are the fundamental interface of the interactive web. Programmatic labels for each data entry field or option selecting widget  on any form are critical for many users requiring accessibility support. Furthermore, consistent grouping and form controls on screen location is also critical.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
Far too many sites fail to use available markup to associate date entry fields and status selection control widgets with the labels the print to screen. These sites expect nondisabled users will simply understand what label applies to what field and widget by virtue of how the two are printed to screen. The user who relies on programmatic association is thus disadvantaged.
</dd>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd>
	Clearly source should be performing this function. That fact that it is missing from so many sites cries out for remediation technology on the edge. Furthermore, advanced strategies to sequence completion of complex forms for persons who are easily overwhelmed by on screen complexity are frustrated when these programmatic associations are missing.
</dd>
<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>
Well built edge technologies can introduce missing programmatic associations. Furthermore, they are the only technologies that can bring consistent organization to a form.

<h3>Guardians and Caretakers</h3>

<p>Whether in support of minor children or aging seniors, overlays that support end user appropriate configuration hosted in a cloud service and capable of propogating to all devices used by the beneficiary end user provide a very valuable service. They enable individuals legally entrusted with the end user's care to refine the configuration of web devices to maximal end user benefit. When facilitation is provided to minor children living with disabilities, it enables them to devote their time with devices to learning, socializing, and entertainment. When facilitated for aging seniors, the benefits are similar even though disability is usually unacknowledged until it becomes severe among this population. In both cases this capability shifts the burden of technological configuration away from the end user who is likely least able to accomplish it effectively for themselves and to an agent more likely capable of accomplishing the task effectively. Note we user the term <q>agent</q> in its formal sense. The agent might be a professional of some kind such as a teacher, a professional in a senior center,  or a specialist in technology for persons of specific types of disability. Equally, it could be a trusted friend or a family member assisting a child or an elder.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Source</dt>
				<dd>Content providers have long sought to tailor UX behavior based on what capabilities could be discovered about the user&apos;s operating environment. What browser is in use? Is a screen reader in use? Indeed, <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#recap3">Google&apos;s automated Recaptcha 3 is deeply dependent on just such data gathering</a>.
				</dd>

				<dt>Trade-offs</dt>
				<dd>While a well-crafted remediation
					        technology may disappear from users&apos; consciousness, it is both
						risky and presumptuous to presume there will be no users who will not
						experience some kind of accessibility challenge even among the best crafted remediation technologies.
						Furthermore, persons with disabilities tend to be  concerned about content
						providers discovering and monetizing  user data. Their lived reality has made
						them highly desirous to preserve their privacy because of perceived and actual
						experience of discrimination over many years.
						        However, the automated UX transformation approach can provide clear benefits. One example is  real-time applications such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/raur/">Real Time Communications (RTC)</a>.
							        Immediacy matters. ASR captions may not provide the desired quality, but the alternative may too often be no captions whatsoever.
								        Similarly missing image descriptions generated by A-I may prove more helpful to the user coping with a substandard page than no alternative text at all.

<p>While not the glamorous <q>holy grail</q> of technology deployment today, human mediation of A-I identified checkpoints, together with the site owner&apos;s active participation to clarify meaning and intent describes the most effective approach available today to accomplish accessibility remediations where they're needed. No other approach delivers equally effective remediations.

<h3>Feature-Bundling Profiles</h3>
